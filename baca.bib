abstract = {This paper explores the role of exchange rate risk in determining local currency sovereign bond yields in emerging market economies (EMEs). We find that EME local currency sovereign bond yields are indeed influenced by exchange rate risk (volatility and expected depreciation of the exchange rate). This finding holds when controlling for endogeneity and a number of key domestic and international factors. We also show that the effect of exchange rate volatility has strengthened over time, particularly since the US Federal reserve announced in May 2013 that it would reduce the pace and size of its large-scale asset purchases. The influence of exchange rate volatility is less pronounced in EMEs with higher shares of foreign ownership of local currency sovereign bonds, larger capital account openness and greater exchange rate flexibility. Our findings have a number of implications for policymakers, in particular as to how emerging market economies can be vulnerable to perception of greater exchange rate risk as global monetary conditions tighten.},

abstract = {The Latin American region has experienced many interdependent issues such as financial crises, unsustainable sovereign spreads, sudden stops in capital flows, capital flight and growth rate collapse. This study focuses on identifying the drivers of sovereign bond spreads by focusing on the role of capital flight. It is worthy to note that no prior study has explicitly examined this relationship. Using data on eight Latin American countries during the period 1993–2015 and based on dynamic heterogeneous panel regression as a panel-ARDL model and the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimator, important outcomes are found out. First, in the long-run, sovereign bond spreads are influenced by the countries' local fundamentals as well as global factors, whereas in the short-run it is mainly the global factors that can be identified as drivers. Second, the capital flight, which is the variable of interest, shows a positive effect on sovereign bond spreads. Indeed, in order to strengthen their debt repayment ability, Latin American countries are presumably called upon to curb and prevent the capital flight. This requires implementing various strategies which range from establishing efficient judicial and political institutions to growth-boosting through controlling the macroeconomic factors.},

In addition, the default risk accounts for only a small fraction of sovereign yield spreads, and a substantial portion is attributable to risk premium and non-default components. In particular, the risk premium is substantially time-varying; moreover, it increases in order to account for a major portion of the heightened yield spread during a financial crisis, implying that global investors prefer to hold safer assets. Therefore, higher risk premiums per unit risk are required than before. Our findings provide evidence on both flight-to-quality and time-varying risk premium.},

abstract = {▀ We expect core government bond yields to trend upwards over the next five years, but based on our modelling work, a big surge in yields looks unlikely. Even our most downbeat scenario implies only moderate rises in debt service costs, suggesting governments will be relaxed about rising yields. ▀ Core government bond yields have been low for over a decade, helped by excess global demand for certain government bonds seen as “safe assets.” But there are historical examples of yields surging after long periods during which they've been low and steady, such as in the US in the 1960s-1970s. ▀ We ran a series of model scenarios that simulate the impact of factors such as a sharp rise in government debt, curtailed QE, reduced demand for core currencies as FX reserves, and higher inflation. Individual shocks to supply and demand for these safe assets add an extra 14bps-70bps to yields. A combined shock adds an extra 130bps to US 10-year yields by 2025, going to 3.5% from our baseline of 2.2% and 0.9% currently. ▀ The rises in yields generated in our scenarios look small by historical standards, although they would imply quite large price changes in bonds given the low starting level of yields. Some of the individual shocks could result in investors suffering losses similar to those in 1994 or 2013–2014. In the combined negative scenario, losses could approach those seen in 1965–1970. ▀ Rising bond yields feed into higher government debt service costs only gradually, especially when average debt maturity is long. As a result, most governments are likely to be quite relaxed about rising yields, and these should not be a big barrier to continued loose fiscal settings. Investors cannot rely on the reimposition of austerity to help limit their downside this time around.},

This result holds for different robustness tests and is found to be stronger for developing countries, for countries with initial lower creditworthiness, and when the degrees of central bank independence and public sector transparency are low. Consequently, compared to existing work emphasizing favorable effects, CDS trading initiation is found to have adverse effects, by increasing the occurrence of SDC.

First, the primary dealer's demand for the auctioned security increases with her/his pre-auction short position. Second, the primary dealer's differential bid shading decreases with her/his pre-auction short position. Third, primary dealers with higher pre-auction short positions assign lower values to the auctioned security.
